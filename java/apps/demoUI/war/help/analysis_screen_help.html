<h1>Analysis View</h1>

<p>If the panels in this view are greyed out, please return to the Activity tab to follow the guided workflow.</p>
<p>You will re-enter this view later in the demo. When you do, click here for the <a href="#yellowdot">Yellow Dot explanation.</a></p> 

<p>Notice that you can now select which metrics are displayed in the lower right panel.</p>
<p>Navigating through the tree in the lower left allows you to select the evidence you need to perfect your understanding of this problem behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Click the "5" Next to Average Response Time</h1>

<p>If the "Analyze by" selector is still set to "metric" you have just exposed the average response time metrics in the grid on the right. You can now decide whether to add or remove them from the chart. </p>

<p>To view a particular metric in isolation or to see why Prelert has classified this metric's behavior as anomalous, you can right click on a metric in the chart and select "Show Data".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Right click on the Idle Threads Metric (purple) in the chart and select "Show Data"</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Yellow Dot Explanation</h1>
<p>Now we see that the previous dip in Idle Thread Count corresponds to the Yellow dot we observed at the onset of this demo.</p>
<p>Note that many of the same metrics involved in the Red Dot activity are detailed here. This Yellow Dot is a 'wobble' or pre-cursor behavior to the Red Dot that likely did not raise alarms.</p>
<p>Prelert Real-Time's predictive capabilities identify these pre-cursor activities that often occur hours before a major incident providing plenty of time to resolve it before users are impacted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Prelert Diagnostics uses advanced analytics to sort through very large volumes of data and identify the chain of events behind performance problems that would otherwise be very difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Prelert Real-Time identifies and provides the same diagnostic narratives for complex problems predictively as they develop.</p>
<p>Now that you are familiar with Prelert, it's time to use it to analyze a real-world performance issue.  Our technical support staff is standing by with answers if you need help.</p>
