<h1>Activity View</h1>

<p>To the right are the results of a sample analysis we've run on a small set of data collected to troubleshoot an application performance problem.</p> 
<p>Prelert has learned the application's behaviors from the data and represents them, in this view, as a  time line of dots. In the real-time version of the product, this view is continuously updated as new data is processed to proactively identify performance issues at their earliest signs.</p>
<p>Blue dots represent activities that Prelert has learned occur consistently over time. Dots register green, yellow, orange or red as they become increasingly rare or contain more anomalous metric behaviors.</p>
<p>The slider at the top left filters this view by severity. At the top right are pan and zoom controls.</p>
<p>The problem we are troubleshooting in this demo caused users to lose orders that they were processing. Prelert has identified the problem and represents it as the Red Dot.</p>
<p>The Yellow Dot occurring a few hours prior turns out to be a pre-cursor to the Red Dot. In a real-time implementation it would have predictively alerted us to the issue in time to avoid user impact.</p>

<h2>Click on the Red Dot</h2>

<p>The Red Dot represents an 'anomalous activity'. Having learned the normal behavior of the application, Prelert has identified a related set of metrics that interacted to cause the problem.</p>
<p>Prelert displays the most prominent metric of each type as defined by the "Analyze by" selector. Changing the selector may cause different prominent metrics to appear.</p>

<h2>Click on "Analyze by:" and select "metric"</h2>

<p>Making sure the "Analyze by:" selector is set to "metric", we see the narrative behind the application problem:</p>
<p>1) An uptick in Orders entered per interval (light blue);</p> 
<p>2) Followed by a drop in Idle Threads (purple) needed to process the orders;</p>
<p>3) A rise in a Response Time metric (red) which, when it reaches a certain value triggers;</p>
<p>4) A sudden spike in Errors (green); and</p>
<p>5) The beginning of the ramp in Cancelled Orders (yellow).</p>

<p>In other words, the Cancelled Orders were preceded by a series of related, chained events. Finding these chained relationships is often the most time consuming aspect of troubleshooting. In real-time mode, Prelert already knows this narrative when it identifies a developing problem.</p>

<p>In the list of metrics in the bottom left panel you will see an icon and hyperlink entitled 'Detailed Analysis'. Clicking on this will bring you to the Analysis view in the context of the current Activity and provide more specific information on the metrics contributing to this Activity.</p>
