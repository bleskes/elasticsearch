<h1>Explorer View</h1>

<p>The Explorer view allows you to navigate your troubleshooting data and view the detail of any individual metric to understand why Prelert classified it as anomalous.</p>

<p>If you have followed the demo workflow, you should have arrived here from the Analysis tab and you should see the "Idle Threads" metric displayed around the time of the problem. If not, you can return to the Analysis tab and follow the guided workflow.</p>

<p>Examining the Idle Threads graph it is easy to see why Prelert flagged this metric as anomalous. It was relatively stable for a long period of time but then dipped suddenly. The sudden change in the metric behaviors are signified by the colored squares overlaid on the graph.</p>

<h1>Click the "Pan Left" arrow six times</h1>

<p>Panning back in time several hours we see that the "Idle Threads" metric had a previous dip, albeit smaller, and of shorter duration.</p>

<p>The colored squares on the graph show the moments in which the metric behaviors have significantly deviated from "normal". </p>
<p>Right clicking on a square and selecting 'Show Analysis' we see that this 'dip' was part of a pre-cursor anomaly that Prelert predictively identified as problematic.</p>
 
<h2>Right-click on the colored square and "Show Analysis" and then click the 'Yellow Dot explanation' link</h2>
