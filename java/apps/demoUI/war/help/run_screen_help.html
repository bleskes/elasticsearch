<h1>Running an Analysis</h1>
<p>Running your own analysis is simple. You point Prelert Diagnostics at the data. Give it the necessary credentials and tell it what data you want to analyze.</p>
<p>Since Prelert Diagnostics was designed to help you find the cause of complex problems, running an analysis against a sparse data set or a data set with a lack of consistent historical data (such as a lab or test instance) may not yield results that highlight Prelert's full value. </p>

<p>Before you run an analysis on a real-world problem, we suggest you take the guided tour of our sample analysis by selecting the Activity tab on the top navigation menu.</p>
