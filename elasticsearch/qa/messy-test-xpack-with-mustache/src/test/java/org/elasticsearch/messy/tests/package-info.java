/**
 * This package contains tests that use mustache to test what looks
 * to be unrelated functionality, or functionality that should be 
 * tested with a mock instead. Instead of doing an epic battle
 * with these tests, they are temporarily moved here to the mustache
 * module's tests, but that is likely not where they belong. Please 
 * help by cleaning them up and we can remove this package!
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If the test is testing templating integration with another core subsystem,
 *       fix it to use a mock instead, so it can be in the core tests again</li>
 *   <li>If the test is just being lazy, and does not really need templating to test
 *       something, clean it up!</li>
