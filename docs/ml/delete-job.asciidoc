== Delete Job API

The delete job API allows you to delete an existing anomaly detection job.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/my_analysis
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

The above example deletes a job called `my_analysis`.
All job configuration, model state and results will be deleted.
A `job_id` must be specified.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a job must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            job directly from the `.ml-*` indices using Elasticsearch's
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.ml-*` indices.

It is not currently possible to delete multiple jobs using wildcards or a comma separated list.
